🎠 Responsive Slider Carousel

A Modern, Fully Functional Image Slider Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

📌 Overview

Web design is becoming increasingly modern and user-focused. In this competitive environment, sliders play a crucial role in determining user engagement—often influencing whether a visitor stays on a website within the first 10 seconds.

This project is a custom-built Slider Carousel that mimics real-world professional designs and is not limited by libraries like Bootstrap or Swiper. Designers often create highly creative concepts, and this slider is coded manually to give developers full control over design, animation, and interactivity.

🚀 Features

This Slider Carousel includes all essential and advanced components of a modern slider:

✔ Navigation Controls

Next and Previous buttons for manually switching slides.

✔ Auto Slide Timer

A horizontal progress bar that counts down until the next automatic slide transition.

✔ Infinite Loop

“Next” can be clicked forever—slides wrap around seamlessly without stopping.

✔ Automatic Slide Transition

Slides automatically move after a specified time interval.

✔ Fully Responsive

Designed to work smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML – for creating the structure and content of the slider
